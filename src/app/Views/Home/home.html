<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    Investment tracker is a platform that allows you to track aspects that affect your investments.
    Investments that share the same risks, factors, regions and groups can be visually distinguished through the generated relationships graphs for each aspect.
    Currently you can add <a href="/Investments">investments</a>, <a href="/Factors">factors</a>, <a href="/Risks">risks</a>, <a href="/Regions">regions</a> and <a href="/Groups">group</a> them.

<p>This app is primarily meant to be used to log your investments, define them and understand the affects that factors have on your investments.</p>
